TO RUN VISUALIZATIONS:

If the submission was made without the data, you need to copy the following data files to the tools/visualiztion/data directory:
* toosl/data/authors_ratio.json
* tools/data/entropy_all.json
* tools/data/entropy_daily.json
* tools/data/entropy_yearly.json
* tools/data/entropy_per_dev.json
* tools/data/entropy_per_year.json
* tools/data/entropy_ext_distribution.json
* tools/data/entropy_ranges_vis.json
* tools/data/entropy_exts_popular.json
Further instructions are included in each html file under tools/visualization.


TO RUN TEST SCRIPTS:

- Add tools folder to the PYTHONPATH:
	export PYTHONPATH=â€œ<location of the folder>/tools:$PYTHONPATH"
- Run test scripts from tools folder as specified in the scripts usage: python3 tests/<test_script>.py
- In order to run the tests, you need to have the test data. If test data was not submitted because of the size limits, you need to run the scripts with test flag set to True in order to create the test data. By default test flag is set to False. Or you can copy the test data from Google Drive.
