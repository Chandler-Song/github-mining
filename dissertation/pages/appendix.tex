Appendices include additional graphs presenting the results of focus analysis.

\section{Yearly Focus}

This section presents four charts for yearly focus (\autoref{fig:yearly_2014-15}, \autoref{fig:yearly_2016-17}). It is visible that \textit{good developers} display higher yearly focus than \textit{bad developers}. However, the difference is quite small and it decreases with years.

Even on the yearly basis the good developers are more focused, although the difference is much less visible than with daily analysis. } \label{fig:yearly_2014-15}
\end{figure}

  \caption[Yearly Focus Chart for 2016 and 2017]{Yearly entropy values for \textit{good} and \textit{bad developers} displayed as overlapping area charts for years 2016 and 2017. Even on the yearly basis the good developers are more focused, although the difference is much less visible than with daily analysis. It is visible that the difference between \textit{good} and \textit{bad developers} gets smaller over years. } \label{fig:yearly_2016-17}

\section{Focus For The Most Popular Extensions}

This section contains charts presenting the focus for each of ten most popular extensions. It is visible that \textit{good developers} are more focused on all but one extension. Ruby files seem to receive the same amount of focus from \textit{good} and \textit{bad developers} alike. Most of the extensions are related to coding, besides .txt, .md which are related to documentation and .lock which is a program file that developers do not write directly into.
