abstract="Developer experience is a common matter of study in the software maintenance and evolution research literature. However it is still not well understood if less experienced developers are more prone to introduce errors in the source code than their more experienced colleagues. This paper aims to study the relationships between experience and the bug introduction ratio using the Mozilla community as case of study.",
