\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chapter:conclusions}
This research analyzed focus of \textit{good developers} based on the file extensions  used in their work. It was discovered that \textit{good developers} focus more during shorter periods of time, but they diversify the technologies they use throughout their careers. Additionally, this paper showed that \textit{good developers} focus more when working on all of the most popular extensions; except for Ruby files, which received smaller amount of focus from all developers. These findings can be used by developers for self-reflection and improvement of their working habits and development process. This type of analysis could also be incorporated into the development tools to allow programmers make data-driven decision easier. The ways in which developers interact with specific extensions can be researched further for the purpose of discovering which technologies require the least of programmers’ attention, and to collect authors’ reasons for switching their focus. Additionally, temporal focus switching analysis can be used to explain developers’ focus over shorter time periods in more detail. All in all, the findings prove that focus is clearly one of the characteristics that make \textit{good developers}.
